=========


Internal dummy repository to test PyScaffold's several UI integrations (FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY)
It should be updated (forcefully if necessary) every time a change that impacts PyScaffold's CI
integrations is made (a PR on PyScaffold's main repository that changes CI is
expected to provide a companion PR to this repository).


Note
====

This project has been set up using PyScaffold 3.2.3.post0.dev40. For details and usage
information on PyScaffold see https://pyscaffold.org/.
